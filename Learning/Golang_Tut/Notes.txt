To RUN:
To run the program, put the code in hello-world.go and use go run.
Sometimes we’ll want to build our programs into binaries. We can do this using go build.
We can then execute the built binary directly. Now that we can run and build basic Go programs, let’s learn more about the language.

= vs :=
Use = for variable assignment when the variable is declared outside a function, when the type needs to be explicitly specified, or when reassigning a variable. 
Use := for short variable declarations inside a function when you want to declare and initialize a variable with a value in a concise manner, and you don't need to explicitly state the type.
