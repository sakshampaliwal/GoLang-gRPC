Flags are like settings you can choose when you run a program from the command line.

Go's flag package helps manage these settings.
You define what settings your program can have, including default values and descriptions.

You define flags with names, default values, and descriptions.
Your program reads these settings when it starts using flag.Parse().

flag.Parse() is a function call that tells your program to look at the command-line arguments and extract any flags you've defined.
Without calling flag.Parse(), your program won't know what flags were provided when it was run.

flag.String():
This function is used to define a command-line flag that expects a string value.
It takes three arguments:
var strFlag = flag.String("flag_name", "default_value", "Description of the flag")

flag.Int():

This function is used to define a command-line flag that expects an integer value.
It takes the same three arguments as flag.String():
var intFlag = flag.Int("flag_name", default_value, "Description of the flag")
